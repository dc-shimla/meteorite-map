# Meteorite Map

Meteorite Map is a web mapping application. It imports meteorite landings dataset from NASAâ€™s open data portal via API endpoint. These landings are then cleaned, clustered based on geographical locations and then plotted on to a map.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Packages:
* [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

* [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/)  

### Installation

Download the .zip of the github repository. Open meteorite_cluster_map.html in your internet browsing application to see the generated map. 

### Running the application

To re-generate meteorite_cluster_map.html, save any changes made to import_data.py, clean_data.py and map_data.py. Then run map_data.py in the terminal using the following command:
